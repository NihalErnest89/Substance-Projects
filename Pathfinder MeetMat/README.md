# Pathfinder MeetMat

This version of MeetMat is known as the Pathfinder. The materials and smart materials, used for the base and metal finish, were created in Substance Alchemist and Substance Designer. The rest of the texturing was designed and made in Substance painter. The 3D Model is a default file provided by Substance Painter, however in the final renders, it was visually altered with tessellation.

## Running

Although the there are 3 programs involved (Substance Painter, Designer, and Alchemist), the main program which was used to design and render was Substance Painter, as the files from the other programs were imported to it
